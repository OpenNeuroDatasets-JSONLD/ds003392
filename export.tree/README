This MEG dataset was prepared in the Brain Imaging Data Structure (MEG-BIDS, Niso et al. 2018) format using MNE-BIDS (Appelhoff et al. 2019).

The dataset contains 10 of the 12 participants from the vision-only training group. 
2 participants were removed, one due to problems with the trigger channel, and one due to different settings in the acquisition preventing us from processing the dataset without prior adjustment. 


## EXPERIMENT

Participants were presented with a cloud of moving dots, always starting with incoherent movement (up or down result in equal display, due to the incoherence). 
After 500 ms, the movement became coherent in 50% of the trials (95% coherence, up or down) and remained incoherent in the other 50%, lasting for 1000 ms. Participants were instructed to passively view the stimuli for a total of 120 trials. 

Events: 

1: coherent / down
2: coherent / up
3: incoherent / down
4: incoherent / up



## MEG

Brain magnetic fields were recorded in a MSR using a 306 MEG system (Neuromag Elekta LTD, Helsinki). MEG recordings were sampled at
2 kHz and band-pass filtered between 0.03 and 600 Hz. 

Four head position coils (HPI) measured the head position of participants before each
block; three fiducial markers (nasion and pre-auricular points) were
used for digitization and anatomicalMRI (aMRI) immediately following
MEG acquisition. 

Electrooculograms (EOG, horizontal and vertical eye
movements) and electrocardiogram (ECG) were simultaneously recorded.
Prior to the session, 5 min of empty room recordings was acquired
for the computation of the noise covariance matrix.

Bad MEG channels were marked manually.


## MRI

The T1 weighted aMRI was recorded using a 3-T Siemens Trio MRI
scanner. Parameters of the sequence were: voxel size: 1.0 × 1.0 ×
1.1 mm; acquisition time: 466 s; repetition time TR = 2300 ms; and
echo time TE = 2.98 ms
